# Zombie-Simulation
School project for Computer Aided Analysis class.
This is a school project. It consists of a zombie apocalypse, starts with a patient 0, which is random every time.  The people, which are the blue circles, bounce around the map until they get infected or they are lucky enough to survive this. The patient 0 turns red just like anyone it collides with. There is also 3 guns in the map, the yellow balls, whoever grabs them turns yellow too. The people with guns can also shoot and kill zombies, stray bullets can hit regular people.
